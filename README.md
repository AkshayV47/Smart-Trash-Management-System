🚮 Smart Trash Management System

The Smart Trash Management System is an IoT-enabled public waste monitoring and management platform built using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi microcontroller and ultrasonic sensing technology. The system continuously measures garbage fill levels inside trash bins by calculating the distance between the ultrasonic sensor and waste surface. Sensor data is processed locally and transmitted wirelessly to a cloud-based IoT dashboard for real-time monitoring and analytics.

The architecture supports multi-integrated data management, enabling structured storage, visualization, and threshold-based event triggering. When the garbage level exceeds a predefined limit, the system generates automated alerts to facilitate optimized waste collection scheduling. This reduces bin overflow, minimizes manual inspection, and improves operational efficiency in public sanitation systems.

The system is designed with scalability and low-power operation in mind, making it suitable for large-scale deployment in smart cities, campuses, industrial zones, and public infrastructure. The modular hardware design allows additional sensor integration such as gas sensors for hazardous gas detection, GPS modules for location tracking, and energy-efficient power sources like solar panels.

By leveraging open-source firmware, IoT protocols, and cloud platforms, the Smart Trash Management System provides a cost-effective, data-driven solution for modern waste management, supporting sustainable urban development and smart city initiatives.
